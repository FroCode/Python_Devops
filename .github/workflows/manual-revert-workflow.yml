            **Steps to resolve:**
            1. Open the 'Files changed' tab in this PR to view conflicts.
            2. Resolve any conflict markers (\`\`\`<<<<<<<\`\`\`, \`\`\`=======\`\`\`, \`\`\`>>>>>>>\`\`\`) directly in GitHub or locally.
            3. Decide whether to:
               - Keep the modified version from HEAD (stage with \`git add <file>\`).
               - Accept the deletion from the revert (stage with \`git rm <file>\`).
            4. Once resolved, commit the changes and push them.
            5. Merge the PR once conflicts are resolved.

            **Conflicted files:**
            \`\`\`
            $CONFLICTED_FILES
            \`\`\`
